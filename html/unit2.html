        <p>
          Lubrication is the admittance of oil between two surfaces having
          relative motion. The purpose of lubrication may be one or more of the
          following:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Reduce friction and wear between the parts having relative motion
          </li>
          <li>
            Cool the surfaces by carrying away heat generated due to friction.
          </li>
          <li>
            Seal a space adjoining the surfaces such as piston rings and
            cylinder liner.
          </li>
          <li>
            Clean the surface by carrying away the carbon and metal particles
            caused by wear.
          </li>
          <li>
            Absorb shock between bearings and other parts and consequently
            reduce noise.

        <h3>Properties of lubricants</h3>
        <p>
          The qualities to be considered in selecting oil for lubrication are:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Viscosity:</strong> It is the ability of the oil to resist
            internal deformation due to mechanical stresses and hence it is a
            measure of the ability of the oil film to carry a load. A more
            viscous oil can carry a greater load, but it will offer greater
            friction to sliding movement of one bearing over other. Viscosity
            varies with temperature and hence if a surface to be lubricated is
            normally at high temperature it should be supplied with oil of a
            higher viscosity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Flash Point:</strong> It is defined as the lowest
            temperature at which the lubricating oil will flash when a small
            flame is passed across its surface. The flash point of the oil
            should be sufficiently high so as to avoid flashing of oil vapors at
            temperatures occurring inside engine.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fire Point:</strong> It is the lowest temperature at which
            the oil burns continuously. The fire point should also be high in a
            lubricating oil, so that oil does not burn in service.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cloud Point:</strong> When subjected to low temperatures the
            oil changes from liquid state to a plastic or solid state. In some
            cases the oil starts solidifying which makes it to appear cloudy.
            The temperature at which this takes place is called the cloud point.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pour Point:</strong> It is the lowest temperature at which
            the lubricating oil will pour. It is an indication of its ability to
            move at low temperatures. This property must be considered because
            of its effect on starting an engine in cold weather and on free
            circulation of oil through exterior feed pipes when pressure is not
            applied.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Oiliness:</strong> This is the property which enables oil to
            spread over and adhere to the surface of the bearing. It is most
            important in boundary lubrication.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Corrosion:</strong> A lubricant should not corrode the
            working parts and it must retain its properties even in the presence
            of foreign matter and additives.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Emulsification:</strong> A lubricating oil, when mixed with
            water is emulsified and loses its lubricating property. The
            emulsification number is an index of the tendency of an oil to
            emulsify with water.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Physical stability:</strong> A lubricating oil must be
            stable physically at the lowest and highest temperatures between
            which the oil is to be used. At the lowest temperature there should
            not be any separation of solids, and at the highest temperature it
            should not vaporize beyond a certain limit.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Chemical Stability:</strong> A lubricating oil should also
            be stable chemically. There should not be any tendency for oxide
            formation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Neutralization number:</strong> It An oil may contain
            certain impurities that are not removed during refining. The
            neutralization number test is a simple procedure to determine
            acidity or alkalinity of an oil. It is the weight in milligrams of
            potassium hydroxide required to neutralize the acid content of one
            gram of oil.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Adhesiveness:</strong> It is the property of lubricating oil
            due to which the oil particles stick with the metal surfaces.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Film strength:</strong> It is the property of a lubricating
            oil due to which the oil retains a thin film between the two
            surfaces even at high speed and load. The film does not break and
            the two surfaces do not come in direct contact. Adhesiveness and
            film strength cause the lubricant to enter the metal pores and cling
            to the surfaces of the bearings and journals keeping them wet when
            the journals are at rest and presenting metal to contact until the
            film of lubricant is built up.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Specific gravity:</strong> It is a measure of density of
            oil. It is an indication regarding the grade of lubricant by
            comparing one lubricant with other. It is determined by a hydrometer
            which flats in the oil, and the gravity is read on the scale of the
            hydrometer at the surface of the oil.

        <h3>Mist Lubrication System</h3>
        <p>
          This system is used for two-stroke cycle engines. Most of these
          engines are crank charged, i.e., they employ crankcase compression and
          thus are not suitable for crankcase lubrication. These engines are
          lubricated by adding 2 to 3 percent lubricating oil in the fuel tank.
          The oil and fuel mixture is induced through the carburettor. The
          gasoline is vaporized; and the oil in the form of mist, goes via
          crankcase into the cylinder. The oil which impinges on the crankcase
          walls lubricates the main and connecting rod bearings, and rest of the
          oil which passes on the cylinder during charging and scavenging
          periods, lubricates the piston, piston rings and the cylinder.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="topic">
        <h3>Wet Sump Lubrication System</h3>
      
          These systems employ a large capacity oil sump at the base of crank
          chamber, from which the oil is drawn by a low-pressure oil pump and
          delivered to various parts. Oil there gradually returns back to the
          sump after serving the purpose.
        </p>

        <h4>Splash system:</h4>
        <a class="img" href="../images/unit2/lubrication01.jpg"><img src="../images/unit2/lubrication01.jpg" alt="Wet sump lubrication system"></a>
        <p>
        <p>
          This system is used on some small four-stroke stationary engines, in
          this system, the caps on the big end bearings of connecting rods are
          provided with scoops which, when the connecting rod is in the lowest
          position, just dip into oil troughs and thus direct the oil through
          holes in the caps to the big end bearings. Due to splash of oil, it
          reaches the lower portion of the cylinder walls, crankshaft and other
          parts requiring lubrication. Surplus oil eventually flows back to the
          oil sump. Oil level in the troughs is maintained by means of an oil
          pump which takes oil from sump, through a filter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Splash system is suitable for low and medium speed engines having
          moderate bearing load pressures. For high performance engines, which
          normally operate at high bearing pressures and rubbing speeds this
          system does not serve the purpose.
        </p>

        <div>
          <h4>Semi-pressure system:</h4>
          <p>
            This method is a combination of splash and pressure systems. It
            incorporates the advantages of both. In this system main supply of
            oil is located in the base of crank chamber. Oil is drawn from the
            lower portion of the sump through a filter and is delivered by means
            of a gear pump at pressure of about 1 bar to the main bearings. The
            big end bearings are lubricated by means of a spray through nozzles.
            Thus, oil also lubricates the cams, crankshaft bearings, cylinder
            walls and timing gears. An oil pressure gauge is provided to
            indicate satisfactory oil supply.
          </p>
          <p>
            The system is less costly to install as compared to pressure system.
            It enables higher bearing loads and engine speeds to be employed as
            compared to splash system.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Full pressure system:</h4>
          <a class="img" href="../images/unit2/lubrication02.jpg"><img src="../images/unit2/lubrication02.jpg" alt="Full pressure lubrication system"></a>
          <p>
            In this system, oil from oil sump is pumped under pressure to the
            various parts requiring lubrication. The oil is drawn from the sump
            through filter and pumped by means of a gear pump. Oil is delivered
            by the pressure pump at pressure ranging from 1.5 to 4 bar. The oil
            under pressure is supplied to main bearings of crankshaft and
            camshaft. Holes drilled through the main crankshafts bearing
            journals, communicate oil to the big end bearings and also small end
            bearings through hole drilled in connecting rods. A pressure gauge
            is provided to confirm the circulation of oil to the various parts.
            A pressure regulating valve is also provided on the delivery side of
            this pump to prevent excessive pressure.
          </p>
          <p>
            This system finds favor from most of the engine manufacturers as it
            allows high bearing pressure and rubbing speeds.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Dry Sump Lubrication System</h3>
          <a class="img" href="../images/unit2/lubrication03.jpg"><img src="../images/unit2/lubrication03.jpg" alt="Dry sump lubrication system"></a>
          <p>
            In this system, the oil from the sump is carried to a separate
            storage tank outside the engine cylinder block. The oil from sump is
            pumped by means of a sump pump through filters to the storage tank.
            Oil from storage tank is pumped to the engine cylinder through oil
            cooler. Oil pressure may vary from 3 to 8 bar. Dry sump lubrication
            system is generally adopted for high-capacity engines.
