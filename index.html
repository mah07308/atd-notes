      <h3>Course Objectives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To study the application of thermal science in mechanical engineering,
          consisting of the fundamental laws and processes for energy conversion
        </li>

        <li>
          To understand thermal design aspects of reciprocating
          machinery-reciprocating compressors and IC Engines.
        </li>

        <li>
          To analyse Rankine cycle applied to thermal power plants and its
          improvements.
        </li>

        <li>
          To gain the knowledge on the power plant thermal Devices-Boilers,
